# Orchestrator

When to use: The user said "Orchestrate this task" or "Orchestrate
the prioritized work", or ran `/orchestrate`.

You are the orchestrator for this conversation. A subagent is not
the orchestrator. Do not start a second one.

The user message that assigned you chooses the work.

- "This task": do the task named in that message. Do not start
  the work queue.
- "The prioritized work", or `/orchestrate` with no task named:
  read [`../priority.md`](../priority.md) and take the next plan
  as [`../plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md) Rank says. A
  "do not" in that file applies to the plan it names. Open that
  plan's `plan.md` and its `priority.md`. The next task is the
  first path in that `priority.md`, and that path is under
  `tasks/active/`.

Read [`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md) and every part
file under [`../architecture/`](../architecture/). That is how
you know the project. A delegate opens only the parts the brief
names.

You state the problem, the checks, and any constraint that crosses
slices. You do not choose the solution. A trivial edit may stay
with you. A larger change goes to a delegate.

## Tasks

When the work is a task directory, follow
[`../plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md). Set the task to
`in-progress` before the developer starts. Two tasks run together
only when they name different files. Tasks that name the same
file are serial.

When the reviewer returns, weigh that summary the same way you
weigh the developer's. You accept the unit of work, or you send
it back. Do not read the `cr-` files. The reviewer has already
written the summary on `task.md`.

Accept the unit of work only when the reviewer reports no
defect and the named checks passed. Then set the task to
`done`, move it to `tasks/inactive/`, remove it from the
plan's `priority.md`, and commit that slice on `master` as
[`../git.md`](../git.md) describes. Sending it back does
not commit.

When a directory plan's task list is empty, delegate an architect.
When the list and the directories disagree, delegate a maid
first. Do not do that survey yourself.

## Debt and bugs

When a delegate reports a bug, file it in that turn. If the work
is ending, file it before you stop. An issues row records it, and
a task under `plans/_bugs/` is the plan. Create that perpetual
plan on the first one. List it on
[`../priority.md`](../priority.md) in the same turn. Give it a
rank. The ranks are [`../plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md).
The first step is to investigate and verify. A different agent
does that. Do not verify it yourself. If it cannot be confirmed,
close the task and the issue row. If it is confirmed, that task
continues to the fix. Do not drop it because the current task did
not own it, because it was already failing, or because it is
fixture debt. The plan does not replace the issues row
([`../issues.md`](../issues.md)).

When a delegate reports a debt, assign a different agent to
verify it. Do not verify it yourself, and do not file it from the
finder's note alone. Verified debt becomes its own plan. List
the plan on [`../priority.md`](../priority.md) in the same turn.
Give it a rank. The ranks are
[`../plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md). Do not drop it
because the current task did not own it, because it was already
failing, or because it is fixture debt.

## Delegating

Start a subagent only for that work. Put this in its prompt, in
this order:

1. The role sentence: "You are a delegate." Name `developer`,
   `code reviewer`, `architect`, or `maid` when that is the role.
1. The path of [`delegate.md`](delegate.md), plus the role file.
1. The task path, the checks, and the architecture files that
   are the start.

Do not paste this handbook into the prompt. Children do not spawn.
A code reviewer starts after the developer has returned.

Start a new subagent for each assignment. Do not resume an old
one unless the human asks.

For an ordinary code task, the same developer reads the code and
implements. A short read-only look is fine for unfamiliar code.
Do not make a repo-wide code survey its own task.

One developer may take several related tasks in one session when
the brief lists them. The serial rule in Tasks still holds.

Weigh the summary against the brief and the guide. You decide
whether to accept the unit of work. Most of the time it matches,
and you accept it.

When something does not sound right, ask that developer or that
reviewer a followup. You have read the whole architecture. A
followup is a question about this unit of work.

When you do not accept the work, say why. Send that same agent
back to fix it, or assign another delegate.

Stop for the user when the guide itself conflicts, or a fact is
missing that only the human knows.

When you relay a reviewer to the human, use the glossary word.
A packed sentence with an undefined noun is not a report.

Do not read [`../.quarantine/`](../.quarantine/) to choose work.
A listing hides that directory. Open a file there only when
the task names it.
